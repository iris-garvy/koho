### what is this?

This repository implements an extension of [sheaf neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.06333) aimed to handle diffusion over k-cells in a cell complex. This implementation differs from typical sheaf neural network implementations, that focus on the 0th cohomology and frequently restrict to graphs based settings, by following the general [spectral theory of cellular sheaves](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01513).

## why?

so we can do diffusion over k-dimensional cells in a cellular sheaf!

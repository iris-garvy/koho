//! Core traits and definitions for constructing a cell complex over arbitrary types.
//!
//! This module provides the fundamental building blocks for topological spaces and
//! CW complexes (cell complexes). It allows for the construction of spaces by
//! attaching cells of various dimensions along their boundaries.
//!
//! # Mathematical Background
//!
//! ## Topology
//!
//! A topology on a set X is a collection of subsets (called open sets) that satisfies:
//! - The empty set and X itself are open
//! - Arbitrary unions of open sets are open
//! - Finite intersections of open sets are open
//!
//! ## Cell Complex (CW Complex)
//!
//! A CW complex is built incrementally by:
//! - Starting with discrete points (0-cells)
//! - Attaching n-dimensional cells along their boundaries to the (n-1)-skeleton
//! - The n-skeleton consists of all cells of dimension ≤ n
//!
//! CW complexes provide a way to decompose topological spaces into simple building blocks:
//! - 0-cells: points
//! - 1-cells: line segments
//! - 2-cells: disks
//! - 3-cells: solid balls, etc.

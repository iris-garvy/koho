//! Neural diffusion layer implementation for cellular sheaves.
//!
//! This module provides a neural network layer that performs diffusion operations on cellular sheaves,
//! allowing for learned signal processing on topological domains. The diffusion is based on the
//! Hodge Laplacian operator and can be used in graph neural networks and other topological learning models.
